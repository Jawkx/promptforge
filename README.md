## Key Features Explained

### Context Library

The context library allows you to:

- Store reusable text snippets for prompt engineering
- Organize contexts with labels and colors
- Search through your context collection
- Copy contexts to your active prompt

### Prompt Editor

The rich text editor provides:

- Markdown-style formatting
- Code syntax highlighting
- Image embedding
- Real-time preview
- Export capabilities

### Real-time Sync

LiveStore integration enables:

- Automatic data synchronization
- Conflict-free collaborative editing
- Offline-first architecture
- Cross-device consistency

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Follow React best practices with functional components
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with the established design system

### State Management

- Use Zustand for local application state
- Use LiveStore for real-time synchronized data
- Keep state minimal and normalized

### Component Architecture

- Build reusable components in `components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components go in `features/`
- Use proper prop typing and default values
