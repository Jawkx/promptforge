  Refactor the user profile page to use modern React hooks.
  - Convert the UserCard class component to a functional component.
  - Create a new CSS file for UserCard styling.
  - Delete the old, unused API documentation.

changesOverview: |
  The primary change was modernizing the `UserCard` component by replacing the class-based lifecycle methods with React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. This improves code readability and aligns with current best practices. A dedicated stylesheet was created for this component, and obsolete documentation was removed to clean up the repository.
